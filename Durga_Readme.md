#  Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of sentiment analysis, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that entails categorizing textual data according to its emotional tone. This project makes predictions about whether a given text conveys a positive, negative , or neutral sentiment by utilizing machine learning techniques.

The project aims to:
- Understanding the sentiment conveyed in textual data, such as reviews, tweets, or feedback, is the project's main goal.
- NLP techniques are used to preprocess and vectorize raw text.
- Develop and assess sentiment classification machine learning models.
- Provide visualizations and performance data to aid in the interpretation of the model.

## Features

- Inspection and Data Loading: Examine class distribution and load structured text data.
- Pipeline for Text Preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - eliminating punctuation and special characters
  - Tokenization
  - eliminating stopwords
  - Optional lemmatization
- Feature Engineering:
  - TF-IDF vectorization or Bag-of-Words: Word embeddings are optional.
- Model Building:
  - Develop a machine learning classifier (such as SVM, Naive Bayes, or Logistic Regression).
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; confusion matrix
- Visualizations:
  - Heatmap of the confusion matrix for sentiment distribution
